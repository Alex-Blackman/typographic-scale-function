# SASS Typograhpic Scale Generator

A bunch of SASS functions to generate a typographic scale using the pentatonic scale - classic typographic scale.

## Motivation

While there are many typescale generators - modular scale - none of them correctly produce the classic typographic scale. The classic typographic scale is pentatonic.

I also created a testing page so that you can see the scale and written some JS so it tells you what the computed font-size is. Of course you can use Developer Tools, but it is tedious to inspect each font.

## Installation


### Manually

Download.

### What no npm/yarn/bower/cdn?

You're kidding right? I have literally no idea how any of that works. If you know, great!

## Documentation

There is this file and some comments in the code. There some variables that you can set. For example you can change the scale from pentatonic to heptatonic, change the base font size and the ratio.

## Contributing

If you know more than I do dive right in and make changes. You can flag issues, but please don't be offended if it goes unanswered. It may be months before I even look.

## Community

You're kidding right? I built this tool for myself. I may blog about it.
